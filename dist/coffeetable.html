While there's no denying that significant improvements will take place there, we believe the PC of the future will be an enabling device--not the thing with which consumers interact directly.<p></p><p>At the June Digital Living Room conference in Dana Point, Calif., IBM's Almaden Research Center brought us a step closer to that future, providing attendees with a glimpse--in the form of the IBM <span class="highlight">Digital Coffee Table</span>--of how they will someday be able to access PC technology without dealing with PCs. The prototype living room media and entertainment center, in fact, looked more like something from Ethan Allen than CompUSA--we're talking furniture, not digital convergence.</p><p></p><p>According to Ted Selker, IBM Fellow and manager of user system ergonomics research at the facility, the <span class="highlight">Digital Coffee Table</span> frees consumers from having to connect several devices with a tangled mess of wires and cables just to get a decent home-entertainment experience. Just plug in the electrical cords and phone line, and you're set.</p><p></p><p>The prototype coffee table combines a multimedia PC, projection display and high-fidelity sound system with speakers. For television viewing, the table projects a 600-lumen picture on a clear wall or projection screen. With a <span class="highlight">Digital Coffee Table</span>, users could also sit on the couch and surf the Internet while listening to books on tape.</p><p></p><p>The research facility created the <span class="highlight">Digital Coffee Table</span> to demonstrate technology; however, Selker says it could be licensed to a manufacturer and sold to consumers, though IBM has no immediate plans to do so. According to Selker, the coffee table is merely part of a larger research project whose goal is to find ways for people to interact more intuitively with machines. Selker's group is also working on an office with computer-projected walls and an exercise machine that acts as a personal trainer--it even dispenses soda when you do a good job.</p></body></html>
